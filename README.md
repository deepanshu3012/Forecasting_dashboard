📊 Sales Data Analysis & Time Series Forecasting Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis and forecasting workflow by integrating Python for data cleaning & forecasting and Power BI for dashboard creation & visualization.

The workflow is divided into two major parts:

Sales Data Analysis Dashboard – Cleaned and modeled sales data in Python, then visualized in Power BI.

Time Series Forecasting Dashboard – Forecasted future sales using Python and visualized predictions in Power BI.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Time Series Libraries

Power BI: Data Modeling, DAX, Interactive Visualizations

Jupyter Notebook: For running Python scripts
⚠ Important Note – Datasets Not Included

The datasets used in this project are not included in this repository due to size and privacy constraints.
To run the Python notebooks:

Replace the dataset file paths in the notebooks with your own dataset.

Ensure the dataset structure matches the one used in this project (columns for Date, Country, Sales, etc.).

🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Sales Dashboard

Open sales_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the script to clean the dataset and save the cleaned file.

Open Sales_Dashboard.pbix in Power BI and link it to the cleaned dataset.

2️⃣ Time Series Forecasting & Forecast Dashboard

Open sales_forecasting.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the forecasting script to generate predictions.

Open Forecast_Dashboard.pbix in Power BI and link it to the forecasted dataset.
